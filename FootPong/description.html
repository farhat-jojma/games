<h2>How to Play Foot Pong</h2>
<p>Are you ready to become a Foot Pong champion? Follow these simple steps to kick, score, and win—just like a mini soccer match on your computer!</p>

<h3>1. Master the Controls</h3>
<p>Press the left and right arrow keys (or A and D) to move your paddle back and forth. Keep your eyes on the bouncing ball so you know exactly when to strike.</p>

<h3>2. Score Goals</h3>
<p>Aim for the gaps at either end of the screen. Every time the ball passes your opponent’s paddle and crosses their goal line, you earn a point. If the ball slips past your paddle, your opponent gets the point instead.</p>

<h3>3. First to the Finish</h3>
<p>Decide on a winning score before you start (for example, 7 or 10 points). The first player to reach that number wins the match and earns the title of “Foot Pong Master”!</p>

<h3>4. Pro Tips for Kids</h3>
<p>Watch how the ball bounces off walls—angles can be your secret weapon. Practice gentle taps and hard kicks to keep your rival guessing. Challenge a friend or play against the computer to hone your skills.</p>

<p>Have fun, practice your timing, and see how many goals you can score in Foot Pong!</p>

&nbsp;
<h2>Controls</h2>

Keep your eyes on the ball—perfect timing will lead to amazing saves and awesome goals!</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks for Foot Pong</h2>

<p><b>1. Aim for the Corners</b><br>
Instead of simply hitting the ball straight, try to angle your paddle so the ball flies towards the corners of your opponent's side. Corner shots can be tricky for others to return, often catching them by surprise!</p>

<p><b>2. Bounce Off the Walls</b><br>
Did you know that the side walls can be your secret advantage? Kick the ball so it bounces off a wall before reaching your opponent. This "bank shot" alters the ball's direction and can give you the perfect chance to score easy points.</p>

<p><b>3. Learn Your Opponent’s Pattern</b><br>
Pay close attention to how your rival reacts. If they always jump early or move to the left, you can guess where the next ball is going. Spotting patterns is like having a superpower in Foot Pong—practice makes pattern detection a second nature!</p>

<p><b>4. Customize Your Ball and Paddle</b><br>
Explore the in-game shop for fun ball and paddle designs. While they don't change how the ball bounces, having a cool look can boost your confidence—and confidence makes you play even better!</p>

<p><b>5. Team Up for Doubles Play</b><br>
Grab a friend and switch to two-vs-two mode. Teamwork means you can cover more ground, set up great plays, and celebrate goals together. Plus, playing with a friend doubles the fun!</p>

<p><b>6. Master the Practice Arena</b><br>
Visit the practice arena to slow things down and focus on timing. Practicing here repeatedly helps build muscle memory, so when you’re back in a real match, your moves flow automatically.</p>

<p><b>7. Track Your Progress on the Leaderboard</b><br>
Keep an eye on your scores and compare them with players worldwide. Setting small goals—like climbing five spots up—makes the game exciting and gives you something to achieve each day.</p>

<p><b>8. Bookmark for Quick Play</b><br>
Since Foot Pong runs directly in your browser, add it to your favorites bar for quick access. No waiting or downloads—click, load, and jump back into the action!</p>

<p>Use these tricks in your next Foot Pong game and watch your score soar. Happy gaming!</p>
